ROADMAP (What goes where)

All source code goes in /src.
All Java source code goes in /src/java
/src/java is organised as a set of Java packages.
All Java source that we write goes in /src/java/cb
/src/java/cb/ui (package cb.ui) is for GUI, not including the actual circuit diagram.
/src/java/cb/desc (package cb.desc) is for the in-memory DESCription of the circuit.
/src/java/cb/layout (package cb.layout) is for layout and SVG generation.
/src/java/cb/simulate (package cb.simulate) is for simulation.

[Feel free to add more sub-packages as needed.]
