		Accepted as the {@code param_name} parameter of CL10#GetDeviceInfo(). Returns a description of the topology used to connect the device to the

		The type of the structure returned can be queried by reading the first unsigned int of the returned data. The developer can use this type to cast the
		returned union into the right structure type.

		Currently, the only supported type in the structure above is #DEVICE_TOPOLOGY_TYPE_PCIE_AMD. The information returned contains the PCI
		Bus/Device/Function of the device, and is similar to the result of the lspci command in Linux. It enables the developer to match between the OpenCL
		device ID and the physical PCI connection of the card.
