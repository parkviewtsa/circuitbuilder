		commands are not required to begin execution until the queue is flushed. In standard usage, blocking enqueue calls serve this role by implicitly
		flushing the queue. Since blocking calls are not permitted in callbacks, those callbacks that enqueue commands on a command queue should either call
		CL10#Flush() on the queue before returning or arrange for CL10#Flush() to be called later on another thread.
