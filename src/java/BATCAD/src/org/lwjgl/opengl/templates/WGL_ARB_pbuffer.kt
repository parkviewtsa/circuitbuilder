		Native bindings to the ${registryLink("ARB", "wgl_pbuffer")} extension.

		This extension defines pixel buffers (pbuffer for short). Pbuffers are additional non-visible rendering buffers for an OpenGL renderer. Pbuffers are
		equivalent to a window that has the same pixel format descriptor with the following exceptions:
		${ol(
			"There is no rendering to a pbuffer by GDI.",
			"The pixel format descriptors used for a pbuffer can only be those that are supported by the ICD.  Generic formats are not valid.",
			"The allocation of a pbuffer can fail if there are insufficient resources (i.e., all the pbuffer memory has been allocated).",
			"""
		The pixel buffer might be lost if a display mode change occurs. A query is provided that can be called after a display mode change to determine the
		state of the pixel buffer.
		"""
		)}
		The intent of the pbuffer semantics is to enable implementations to allocate pbuffers in non-visible frame buffer memory. These pbuffers are intended to
		be "static" resources in that a program will typically allocate them only once rather than as a part of its rendering loop.  (Pbuffers should be
		deallocated when the program is no longer using them -- for example, if the program is iconified.)

		The frame buffer resources that are associated with a pbuffer are also static and are deallocated when the pbuffer is destroyed or possibly when a
		display mode change occurs.

		Requires ${WGL_ARB_extensions_string.link} and ${WGL_ARB_pixel_format.link}.
