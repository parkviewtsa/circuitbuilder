		Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

		This extension introduces a $include GLSL directive to allow reusing the same shader text in multiple shaders and defines the semantics and syntax of
		the names allowed in $include directives. It also defines API mechanisms to define the named string backing a $include.

		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		The GLSL $include mechanism looks up paths in a tree built through the OpenGL API. This appendix describes the syntax and semantic model of the tree and
		paths into the tree. How the tree is used is up to users of the tree, like the OpenGL API or GLSL.

		<h3>The Tree</h3>

		The tree is a singly rooted hierarchy of tree locations. The root may have one or more child locations, and any location may in turn have its own
		children. Except for the root, each location has exactly one parent; the root has no parent.

		<h3>Paths into the Tree</h3>

		The locations in the tree are created or looked up by path strings. The path string "/" locates the root of the tree. The path "/foo" locates the child
		"foo" of the root. Formally, a valid path is a sequence of tokens delimited by the beginning of the string, by the path-separator forward slash ( / ),
		and by the end of the string. The string "foo/bar" has two tokens; "foo" and "bar". The string "/foo/./bar" has 3 tokens; "foo", ".", and "bar". The
		string "/foo/.." has two tokens; "foo" and "..". The string "/foo/.bar" has two tokens; "foo" and ".bar". A path is invalid if
		${ul(
			"""
			{@code path} contains any characters not listed in Section 3.1 "Character Set", or the double quote character, or angled brackets, or any white
			space characters other than the space character.
			""",
		    "{@code path} has consecutive forward slashes ( // ); \"/foo//bar\" is not valid (zero length tokens are not allowed).",
		    "{@code path} ends with a forward slash ( / )",
		    "{@code path} contains no characters."
		)}
		There are no path escape characters, so there is no way to get the forward slash delimiter within a single token.

		When using a path to lookup a tree location, the path tokens are used to walk the tree. The initial location to start the walk is specified by the user
		of the tree and is updated as follows by the tokens in the path. (Paths starting with "/" will start at the root.) Taken left to right:

		The token ".." walks to the parent. Or, if already at the root, then the location remains at the root.

		The token "." leaves the location unchanged.

		Any other token is considered the name of a child of the current location, and walks to that child. (If there is no child of that name, this may result
		in a failed lookup or in the child being created, as specified by the user of the tree for the operation being performed.)

		<h3>Associated Strings</h3>

		Each location in the tree can have an additional string associated with it (that a user like the $include mechanism can use as an included string). This
		is true even for locations that have children: "/foo/bar" can exist in the tree at the same time that "/foo" has an additional string associated with
		it. Typically, when a path is used to find a location in the tree, it is for the purpose of returning this associated string.

		Hence, the tree can be built from a collection of (path,string) pairs, where path is a string establishing the existence of a location in the tree and
		string is the string associated with the node. Details of how to do this are specified by the user of the tree.

		Requires GLSL 1.10.
