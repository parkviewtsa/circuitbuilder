		When true, the $registryLink extension is supported.

		This extension provides alternative conventions for the fragment coordinate XY location available for programmable fragment processing.
		
		The scope of this extension deals *only* with how the fragment coordinate XY location appears during programming fragment processing. Beyond the scope
		of this extension are coordinate conventions used for rasterization or transformation.

		In the case of the coordinate conventions for rasterization and transformation, some combination of the viewport, depth range, culling state, and
		projection matrix state can be reconfigured to adopt other arbitrary clip-space and window-space coordinate space conventions. Adopting other clip-space
		and window-space conventions involves adjusting existing OpenGL state. However it is non-trivial to massage an arbitrary fragment shader or program to
		adopt a different window-space coordinate system because such shaders are encoded in various textual representations.

		The dominant 2D and 3D rendering APIs make two basic choices of convention when locating fragments in window space. The two choices are:
		${ol(
			"Is the origin nearest the lower-left- or upper-left-most pixel of the window?",
		    "Is the (x,y) location of the pixel nearest the origin at (0,0) or (0.5,0.5)?"
		)}
		OpenGL assumes a lower-left origin for window coordinates and assumes pixel centers are located at half-pixel coordinates. This means the XY location
		(0.5,0.5) corresponds to the lower-left-most pixel in a window.

		Other window coordinate conventions exist for other rendering APIs. X11, GDI, and Direct3D version through DirectX 9 assume an upper-left window origin
		and locate pixel centers at integer XY values. By this alternative convention, the XY location (0,0) corresponds to the upper-left-most pixel in a window.

		Direct3D for DirectX 10 assumes an upper-left origin (as do prior DirectX versions) yet assumes half-pixel coordinates (unlike prior DirectX versions).
		By the DirectX 10 convention, the XY location (0.5,0.5) corresponds to the upper-left-most pixel in a window.

		Fragment shaders can directly access the location of a given processed fragment in window space. We call this location the "fragment coordinate".

		This extension provides a means for fragment shaders written in GLSL or OpenGL assembly extensions to specify alternative conventions for determining
		the fragment coordinate value accessed during programmable fragment processing.

		The motivation for this extension is to provide an easy, efficient means for fragment shaders accessing a fragment's window-space location to adopt the
		fragment coordinate convention for which the shader was originally written.

		When true, the $registryLink extension is supported.

		This extension provides new built-in functions to compute the composite of a set of boolean conditions across a group of shader invocations. These
		composite results may be used to execute shaders more efficiently on a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) processor. The set of shader invocations
		across which boolean conditions are evaluated is implementation-dependent, and this extension provides no guarantee over how individual shader
		invocations are assigned to such sets. In particular, the set of shader invocations has no necessary relationship with the compute shader local work
		group -- a pair of shader invocations in a single compute shader work group may end up in different sets used by these built-ins.

		Compute shaders operate on an explicitly specified group of threads (a local work group), but many implementations of OpenGL 4.3 will even group
		non-compute shader invocations and execute them in a SIMD fashion. When executing code like
		${codeBlock("""
if (condition) {
	result = do_fast_path();
} else {
	result = do_general_path();
}""")}
		where {@code condition} diverges between invocations, a SIMD implementation might first call do_fast_path() for the invocations where {@code condition}
		is true and leave the other invocations dormant. Once do_fast_path() returns, it might call do_general_path() for invocations where {@code condition} is
		false and leave the other invocations dormant. In this case, the shader executes *both* the fast and the general path and might be better off just using
		the general path for all invocations.

		This extension provides the ability to avoid divergent execution by evaluting a condition across an entire SIMD invocation group using code like:
		${codeBlock("""
if (allInvocationsARB(condition)) {

		The built-in function allInvocationsARB() will return the same value for all invocations in the group, so the group will either execute do_fast_path()
		or do_general_path(), but never both. For example, shader code might want to evaluate a complex function iteratively by starting with an approximation
		of the result and then refining the approximation. Some input values may require a small number of iterations to generate an accurate result
		(do_fast_path) while others require a larger number (do_general_path). In another example, shader code might want to evaluate a complex function
		(do_general_path) that can be greatly simplified when assuming a specific value for one of its inputs (do_fast_path).

		There is a common optimization for hardware accelerated implementation of OpenGL which relies on an early depth test to be run before the fragment
		shader so that the shader evaluation can be skipped if the fragment ends up being discarded because it is occluded.

		This optimization does not affect the final rendering, and is typically possible when the fragment does not change the depth programmatically. (i.e.: it
		does not write to the built-in {@code gl_FragDepth} output). There are, however a class of operations on the depth in the shader which could still be
		performed while allowing the early depth test to operate.

		This extension allows the application to pass enough information to the GL implementation to activate such optimizations safely.
