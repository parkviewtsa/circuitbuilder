		Returns the address of the extension function named by {@code procName}. The pointer returned should be cast to a function pointer type matching the
		extension function's definition in that extension specification. A return value of $NULL indicates that the specified function does not exist for the
		implementation.

		A non-$NULL return value for {@code glXGetProcAddress} does not guarantee that an extension function is actually supported at runtime. The client must
		also query GL11##glGetString()(GL11##GL_EXTENSIONS) or GLX11#QueryExtensionsString() to determine if an extension is supported
		by a particular context.

		GL function pointers returned by {@code glXGetProcAddress} are independent of the currently bound context and may be used by any context which
		supports the extension.

		{@code glXGetProcAddress} may be queried for all of the following functions:
