		Native bindings to the ${registryLink("AMD", "wgl_gpu_association")} extension.

		There currently is no way for applications to efficiently use GPU resources in systems that contain more than one GPU. Vendors have provided methods
		that attempt to split the workload for an application among the available GPU resources. This has proven to be very inefficient because most
		applications were never written with these sorts of optimizations in mind.

		This extension provides a mechanism for applications to explicitly use the GPU resources on a given system individually. By providing this
		functionality, a driver allows applications to make appropriate decisions regarding where and when to distribute rendering tasks.

		Requires ${WGL_ARB_extensions_string.link} and ${registryLinkTo("EXT", "framebuffer_object")}.
