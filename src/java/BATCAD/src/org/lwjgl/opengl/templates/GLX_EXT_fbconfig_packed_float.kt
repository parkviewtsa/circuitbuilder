		Native bindings to the ${registryLink("EXT", "packed_float")} extension.

		This extension adds a new 3-component floating-point texture format that fits within a single 32-bit word.  This format stores 5 bits of biased exponent
		per component in the same manner as 16-bit floating-point formats, but rather than 10 mantissa bits, the red, green, and blue components have 6, 6, and
		5 bits respectively. Each mantissa is assumed to have an implied leading one except in the denorm exponent case.  There is no sign bit so only
		non-negative values can be represented.  Positive infinity, positive denorms, and positive NaN values are representable.  The value of the fourth
		component returned by a texture fetch is always 1.0.

		This extension also provides support for rendering into an unsigned floating-point rendering format with the assumption that the texture format
		described above could also be advertised as an unsigned floating-point format for rendering.

		The extension also provides a pixel external format for specifying packed float values directly.

		Requires ${GLX13.glx}.
