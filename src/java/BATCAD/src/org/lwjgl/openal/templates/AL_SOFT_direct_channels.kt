		Native bindings to the $specLinkOpenALSoft extension.

		This extension allows a multi-channel source to play without virtualized output speakers. By default, OpenAL requires buffer channels to be down-mixed
		to the output channel configuration, possibly using HRTF or other virtualization techniques to give a sense of speakers that may not be physically
		present. Sometimes audio tracks are authored with their own spatialization effects, where the AL's virtualization methods can cause a notable decrease
		in audio quality.

		This extension provides a mechanism for applications to specify whether audio should be filtered according to the AL's channel virtualization rules for
		multi-channel buffers.
