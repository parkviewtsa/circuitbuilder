		Native bindings to the $specLinkOpenALSoft extension.

		This extension adds a method to retrieve the total length of a source's buffer data in bytes, samples, and seconds, which correspond to the byte,
		sample, and seconds offset extents. By default, OpenAL only provides a way to retrieve a buffer's storage size in bytes, which does not necessarily
		represent the data size given to alBufferData nor the byte offset extent for the source's #BYTE_OFFSET property. The
		{@link SOFTBufferSamples AL_SOFT_buffer_samples} extension allows an application to query a buffer for its length in bytes, samples, and seconds, but
		this is only for a single buffer; a buffer queue on a source still requires additional bookkeeping by the application to keep track of the length of
		each buffer being queued and unqueued on a given source. This extension aims to ease that and provide a simple query.
