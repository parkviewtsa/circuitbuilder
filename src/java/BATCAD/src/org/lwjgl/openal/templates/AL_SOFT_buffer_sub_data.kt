		To update a section of buffered sample data, use the function alBufferSubDataSOFT.
		The named {@code buffer} may be attached to a source (either queued or by the
		AL_BUFFER property), and the source does not need to be stopped, paused,
		or in an initial state to be modified.

		The {@code offset} value is the number of bytes from the start of the original
		data, and {@code length} is the number of bytes of the original data, to modify.
		If either {@code offset} or {@code length} are negative, or if the sum of {@code offset} and
		{@code length} reaches beyond the end of the buffer, an AL_INVALID_VALUE error
		is generated. For compressed formats, {@code length} and {@code offset} must be block
		aligned. Complex compressed formats (such as those with no constant block
		alignment), may not be modified and will result in an AL_INVALID_ENUM
		error.

		The specified {@code format} is the sample format of the passed {@code data}. The
		passed format must exactly match the format passed to alBufferData, or an
		AL_INVALID_ENUM error is generated.


		When modifying a playing source's buffer, an application must take care to
		not modify the section that is currently being played. The read-only
		source attributes

		  AL_BYTE_RW_OFFSETS_SOFT
		  AL_SAMPLE_RW_OFFSETS_SOFT

		may be used to retrieve the read and write cursor offsets. Behavior is
		undefined if an attempt is made to modify buffer data between the read and
		write offsets.
